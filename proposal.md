# Project Roadmap: TSL-WebGPU Engine

**Objective:** Build a comprehensive WebGPU engine using `fragments-boilerplate` as the foundation, aligned with the specific architectural vision and guiding principles provided in the proposal documents.

## **Phase 0: Initialization & Planning**
*Goal: Establish the project foundation, directory structure, and strategic documentation.*

1.  **Foundation Setup**
    *   Create a new project directory.
    *   Clone the base repository: `https://github.com/phobon/fragments-boilerplate.git`.
    *   **Analysis:** Analyze the boilerplate code to determine necessary modifications to align with:
        *   `.RESOURCES\PROPOSAL DOCS\TSL-WebGPU Engine — Architecture & Implementation Plan.md`
        *   `.RESOURCES\PROPOSAL DOCS\TSL-WebGPU Engine — Vision & Guiding Principles.md`

2.  **Documentation & Strategy**
    Create the following strategic documents to guide development:
    *   **Vision & Architecture Plan:** A consolidated document merging the "Vision & Guiding Principles" and "Architecture & Implementation Plan".
    *   **Inventory & Integration Plan:** A detailed plan for porting resources, managing inventory, and integrating external modules.
    *   **Knowledge Base:** A repository for all other necessary information, research, and technical notes.

3.  **Structure Setup**
    *   Set up the complete folder structure for the engine.

## **Phase 1: Resource Inventory & Aggregation**
*Goal: Centralize assets, scripts, and references for integration.*

1.  **Inventory Collection**
    *   Create a temporary `_inventory` or `modules_staging` folder within the project.
    *   Gather and copy relevant assets, scripts, and modules from the local `.RESOURCES` directory, specifically targeting:
        *   `.RESOURCES\REPOSITORIES`
        *   `.RESOURCES\three.js-r181\examples` (WebGPU and TSL nodes)
        *   `TSLwebgpuExamples`
        *   Portfolio examples.
2.  **Knowledge Update**
    *   Review changelogs and documentation for Three.js r181 and WebGPU to ensure all technical information is up-to-date.
    *   Identify useful nodes, helpers, effects, and components from the collected examples for porting.

## **Phase 2: Core Implementation & Showcase**
*Goal: Build the working core system and demonstrate capabilities.*

1.  **Core Development**
    *   Execute the modification plan to transform `fragments-boilerplate` into the custom TSL-WebGPU Engine.
    *   Implement all "Todo" tasks related to core system functionality.
    *   Ensure the system is fully working and ready for use.
2.  **Showcase System**
    *   Develop an advanced Content System and Showcase Gallery.
    *   Create "Sketches" (examples) for each module to visually represent their functionality.
3.  **Testing**
    *   Perform full system testing to verify module correctness and stability.

## **Phase 3: Expansion (formerly Phase 4)**
*Goal: Extend the system with advanced features.*

1.  **Porting & Expansion**
    *   Implement additional items and advanced modules from the collected resources.
    *   Expand the system capabilities based on the "Inventory & Integration Plan".
