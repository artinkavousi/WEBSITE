- first create a new folder and git Clone of  fragments-boilerplate: `git clone https://github.com/phobon/fragments-boilerplate.git`  as we want to use it as our foundation and epand and modify it furthur more
analyze it , how we can modify it to achieve similar goal as these documents:
our vision goal documents in :
.RESOURCES\PROPOSAL DOCS
PROPOSAL DOCS\TSL-WebGPU Engine — Architecture & Implementation Plan.md
PROPOSAL DOCS\TSL-WebGPU Engine — Vision & Guiding Principles.md

phase 0:
Create and build all the structure and folders and also
create  a proposal document of how to achieve our gooal and expand and enhance it and modifications
-1doc for all the  Vision & Guiding Principles,Architecture & Implementation Plan
and 1 doc for Implementation of inventory & Resource collection and port and Integration Plan
and 1 doc for oall other infos and knowladge and other information we might be need

then we want to collect ourr resource and inventory plan
phase 1 :
gather and collect all of the examples and scripts and modules and assets we wanna  have from our resource inventory and collect them create new folder in our project folder and temprarly modules andinventory container and copy them in there so we can use them
and also
 update knowladge and research all information and changelogs and any other informations that needed and make everything ready

our resources and inventory:
@.RESOURCES\REPOSITORIES@REPOSITORIES @three.js-r181 
 portfolio examples 
 TSLwebgpuExamples 
 three.js-r181 webgpu and tsl node : .RESOURCES\three.js-r181\examples
there is several projects and examples and also threejs webgpu examples \three.js-r181\examples

there is several working projects and repositories and webgpu pipeline  check them and find useful examples or nodes and tsl modules and scripts and  helpers and modules and effect and component  and such that we can port  to our system for more advance and better more pre build modules to use 
so we want to continue build over that and adopt it to add and develope it more base on

phase2
start  implement all the todo task related to compeelte our  modification and adjustmenst and all changes needed to build our core system fully working and ready to use

phase 4
satart implement all the additional and ported items to expand our system from our resources 




perform a comepelte test and run all the modules and their sketches(examples) make sure we have a collection fo sketchess for all the modules and run and test them and take screenshot make sure they render exactly as what they should be@Browser
