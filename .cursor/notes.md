we want to build our project base on below:


- first create a new folder and git Clone of  fragments-boilerplate: `git clone https://github.com/phobon/fragments-boilerplate.git`  as we want to use it as our foundation and epand and modify it furthur more
analyze it , how we can modify it to achieve similar goal as these documents:
our vision goal documents in :
.RESOURCES\PROPOSAL DOCS
PROPOSAL DOCS\TSL-WebGPU Engine — Architecture & Implementation Plan.md
PROPOSAL DOCS\TSL-WebGPU Engine — Vision & Guiding Principles.md

Create and build all the structure and folders and also
create  a proposal document of how to achieve our gooal and expand and enhance it and modifications
-1doc for all the  Vision & Guiding Principles,Architecture & Implementation Plan
and 1 doc for oall other infos and knowladge and other information we might be need

then we want to collect ourr resource and inventory plan
create new INVENTORY folder 
then anaalyz our resouirces and exqamples and such in depth and copy  item for portin the folder +1 doc for Implementation of inventory & Resource collection and port and Integration Plan
gather and collect all of the examples and scripts and modules and assets we wanna  have from our resource inventory and collect them create new folder in our project folder and temprarly modules andinventory container 

our resources and inventory:
@.RESOURCES\REPOSITORIES@REPOSITORIES @three.js-r181 
 portfolio examples 
 TSLwebgpuExamples 
 three.js-r181 webgpu and tsl node : .RESOURCES\three.js-r181\examples
there is several projects and examples and also threejs webgpu examples \three.js-r181\examples

there is several working projects and repositories and webgpu pipeline  check them and find useful examples or nodes and tsl modules and scripts and  helpers and modules and effect and component  and such that we can port  to our system for more advance and better more pre build modules to use 
so we want to continue build over that and adopt it to add and develope it more base on



then first start all the modificationand upgrade and adjustemnts of our foundation and its artitechture and structure compeletly

start  implement all the todo task related to compeelte our  modification and adjustmenst and all changes needed to build our core system fully working and ready to use
and also create much beter and more advance and nicer showcase(our sketches) that reperesnts examples fore each module

upgrade and improve our sketches system:
goal is to have a well designed and UI UX and content management system that use for showcase each of the modules and there feature and capability with sleek and elegand design and smart cms system behind it  better layout and uiux design and gallery 
andd better more smart and unified and orgnized pipeline for our system and their examples 

im thinking of having a modules that take care of all of the setting up webgpu and enviroment and 3d gizmos andcamera and light and create a universal base template for each example to buidl on and can have better more orgnized and more self contaned standalone modules and their examples + it take care of all control panel system
we want a dynamic control panel with glassmorphism style (leva base) with sch3ema driven and it can be great if we can make it automatic that can easly and confidently build appropreate control panel related for each examples in smart and dynamic and interactively and well structred
and everything be consolidated and clean and free from complexity
analyze current implementation and 
give me your suggesstions and proposal and best approach 
create a proposal todo/task doc

everymodules we gonna have a perfect and fully worknig and adopted to our pipeline scene and example for each

and always wew want the best and high quality and production ready  outcome and fully functioning

also keep in mind as our foundation is already a fully working and functioning + all the items for invetory and porting are from resources and example or threejs  itself so all of them are fully working so always do direct implementations of scripts and files exactly as what they are do not reinver or try to create from fresh and cause issues or unneccesserly complications or syntax error and such just do direct iplimentation with minimun modification to just align with our pipeline

also we want comepelte and well planned testing system 
perform a comepelte test and run all the  implementations and changes and  modules and their sketches(examples) make sure we have a collection fo sketchess for all the modules and run and test them and for all examples and modules make sure you analyze its screenshot accuratly and make sure it   shows exactly what it suppose to be and not base on  assumption @Browser

and when we have everything fully working and all setup we gonna start all the implementations and porting modules from inventory and expand it further

1.ccreate all files structures and documentation and todo/task list
then do all the pipeline and system and cores fully implemented and some core modules and some examples
so we know our pipeline and ui ux layout upgrade is fdully working

then start impleementing more modules and port items from inventory and their examples












@.RESOURCES contain aa collection of examples and repos +threejs repo (docs+examples)
do a comepelte and throughly and in depth analyze check all files folesers/subfolder and create a ultimate source of knowladge with all the accurate information and scrtipts and content from them
as all lib andthree js all are fiully functioning and accurate so make sure you yuse correct and accurate content and direct scripts and correct api and syntaxx as they are
our main goal is a comepelte and comprehensive that include all of information and knowladge resource of  threejs,TSL  node , wwebgpu and all of its usecaases scripts api nodes and all integration informations and everyhthing around that 



comepelte it and do compelete run and test and take screenshot make sure everything works correctly



@fragments-boilerplate check project ands current state and implreementaations 
and see what leftr and create todo sche list ands start implement and develope it furth ur


perform a comepelte test and run all the recent implementations and changes and  modules and their sketches(examples) make sure we have a collection fo sketchess for all the modules and run and test them and take screenshot make sure they render exactly as what they should be@Browser
